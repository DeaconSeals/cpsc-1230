# Exam 1 and Lab Test 1

Exam 1 and Lab Test 1 will be open from **12:01 AM CT Friday, November 7 until
11:59 PM CT Monday, November 10**. Each has a 75-minute time limit, and you can
can each in any 75-minute time period that begins no earlier than the opening
time and ends no later than the closing time. You must complete each in one
sitting, and you may not use any outside resources on either.

Exam 1 will be delivered as a multiple-choice Canvas quiz using LockDown, and
covers the material in Module 1 and Module 2. To ensure that you have the 
LockDown Browser set up, M0: Hands-On: Respondus LockDown Browser does not lock
and can be repeated an arbitrary number of times. Lab Test 1 will be delivered
as a programming task in Vocareum, and consists of two small, focused programming
problems covering material from Module 1 and Module 2. Practice opportunities
for each are available in Canvas under Assignments -> Practice Exams and Tests.
I've also recorded an Exam 01 Review lecture linked below, which also briefly
discusses the lab test.

Good luck!
