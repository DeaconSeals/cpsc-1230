# Welcome to CPSC 1230 Summer 2025!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this term. 

The course begins today with Module 0, a "getting started' set of activities and
information designed to prepare you for the course content in Modules 1 through
Module 7. Module 0 may seem a bit "meta" but I think the information is well
worth taking the time to digest and, hopefully, put into practice. 

Most of the video lectures you'll see were recorded by my colleague and the
course coordinator, Dr. Hendrix, though I've been teaching this course in
person for the past year and I'll be your active instructor for the semester.
This semester, I plan to add introduce some new lectures to help you tackle
for some of the trickier assignment problems and review for the lab tests and
exams. So, you'll probably hear a lecture from me at some point!

Welcome to the course, and War Eagle!
