# Explaining course due dates 

It might be good to clarify how due dates on graded items work in the course.
First, here are the relevant statements from the syllabus and from M0: Course
Structure and Workflow.

"*All assignments are due no later than the date and time specified in Canvas,
and no late submissions are accepted. If you believe that your situation
warrants an exception to this policy (e.g., medical emergency) you must treat
this as an absence and have the absence excused (see policy).*" - Course
Syllabus, Late Assignment Submission

"*All graded items are scheduled to be due or delivered on module boundaries.
Specifically: Each graded item in the course is due on the last day of the
module that contains it. There are late days for assignments and slip days for
exams, tests, and activities, but the actual due date for everything is the
last day of each module.*" - M0: Course Structure and Workflow

To make sure you understand how these statements are applied to Assignments,
Exams, Lab Tests, and Hands-On Activities, you'll want to pay close attention
to the "due" and "until" dates in Canvas. The "due" date records the official
due date for a graded item and the "until" date records the latest date that a
graded item will be accepted without penalty.

So, in brief, here's how this works for each category of graded item.

**Assignments** - Available the first day of the module (Monday), due the last day
of the module (Sunday), but can be submitted without penalty until 11:59 PM CT
Wednesday after the module.

**Exams** - Available the Friday of the module, due the Monday of the module, and
can't be submitted after the due date. You can choose any 75-minute period that
begins no earlier than 12:01 AM CT Friday and ends no later than 11:59 PM CT
Monday.

**Lab Tests** - Available the Friday of the module, due the Monday of the module,
and can't be submitted after the due date. You can choose any 75-minute period
that begins no earlier than 12:01 AM CT Friday and ends no later than 11:59 PM
CT Monday.

**Hands-On Activities** - Available the first day of the module (Monday), due the
last day of the module (Sunday), but can be submitted without penalty until
11:59 PM CT on the last day of the course.

I hope this helps to clarify things, but just reach out if you have any
questions.
