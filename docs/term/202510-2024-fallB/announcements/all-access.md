# Accessing Vocareum

You will access Vocareum **through Canvas** by clicking on the "Load in a new
window" button at the bottom of a graded item that uses Vocareum. The first
time that you access Vocareum (in Module 0), your Vocareum account will be
linked to your Canvas account so that grades can be passed from Vocareum to
Canvas. 

The fee for using Vocareum has been waived this semester. If you are prompted
to pay for Vocareum access, notify your instruction and do not make a payment.

time that you access Vocareum (in Module 0), you will need to enter the
**access code** provided to you by the AU All Access program via an email from
`noreply@auburn.edu`. This email is sent the day before classes began for the
full semester, and could be automatically  moved in to your Junk folder. You
will only need the access code the first time you use Vocareum.
