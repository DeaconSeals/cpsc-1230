# Lab Test 3 and Final Exam Information

The Final Exam and Lab Test 3 will be open from **12:01 AM CT Friday, February 20
until 11:59 PM CT Wednesday, February 25** (the last day of the semester). Each
has a 75-minute time limit, and you can can each in any 75-minute time period
that begins no earlier than the opening time and ends no later than the closing
time. You must complete each in one sitting, and you may not use any outside
resources on either.

The Final Exam will be delivered as a multiple-choice Canvas quiz, and covers the
material in Modules 5, 6, 7. Lab Test 3 will be delivered as a
programming task in Vocareum, and consists of two small, focused programming
problems covering material from Modules 5, 6, and 7. Practice opportunities
for each are available in Canvas under Assignments -> Practice Exams and Tests.
I've also recorded a Final Exam Review lecture linked below, which also briefly
discusses the lab test.

Good luck!
