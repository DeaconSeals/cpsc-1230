# Remaining modules open, due dates are last day of classes

To hopefully relieve some of the time compression you must be feeling, and to
just make things a bit easier on everyone, I've opened up all remaining modules
and I've set the due date for every remaining deliverable (including those for
the current module) to be the last day of classes for the term: **Thursday,
March 3, 2022**.

I hope this helps everyone to breathe a little easier today!

War Eagle!
