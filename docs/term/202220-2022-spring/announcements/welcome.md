# Welcome to CPSC 1230 Spring A 2022!

This is a course in data structures and algorithms, and is one of the most
important foundational courses in the curriculum. It's one of my favorite
courses to teach and I'm looking forward to this term. 

The course begins today with Module 0, a "getting started' set of activities and
information designed to prepare you for the course content in Modules 1 through
Module 7. Module 0 may seem a bit "meta" but I think the information is well
worth taking the time to digest and, hopefully, put into practice. 

Welcome to the course, and War Eagle!
